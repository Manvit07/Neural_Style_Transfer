# üé® Neural Style Transfer ‚Äì CodTech Internship Task 3

This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of **Neural Style Transfer** using PyTorch and Google Colab. It was created as part of the **CodTech Artificial Intelligence Internship (Task 3)**. The goal of this task is to take two images ‚Äî a **content image** and a **style image** ‚Äî and generate a new image that retains the structure of the content image but appears as if it were painted in the artistic style of the style image.

## üìå What is Neural Style Transfer?

**Neural Style Transfer** is a deep learning technique that blends the "content" of one image with the "style" of another. It was introduced in the paper *"A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style"* by Gatys et al. (2015). The technique uses the feature maps extracted by a **pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN)** ‚Äî typically VGG19 ‚Äî to combine structural elements and artistic textures.

## üñºÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Upload Two Images**  
   - A **Content Image** (e.g., a bird, landscape, or portrait).  
   - A **Style Image** (e.g., artwork, painting, or abstract texture).

2. **Load Pretrained Model**  
   - We use VGG19 from PyTorch‚Äôs `torchvision.models` as the base network.

3. **Extract Features**  
   - From content and style layers to calculate feature differences.

4. **Define Loss Functions**  
   - **Content Loss**: Measures how much the target image differs from the content.
   - **Style Loss**: Measures how much the target deviates from the texture of the style image (using Gram matrices).

5. **Optimize the Output Image**  
   - A randomly initialized image (starting from the content image) is updated using backpropagation until it resembles the desired blend of content and style.

6. **Display & Save Result**  
   - The final image is visualized and can optionally be saved.

## üöÄ How to Use This Project

1. **Open Google Colab**  
   Visit: https://colab.research.google.com/

2. **Upload the `.ipynb` Notebook**

3. **Upload Two Images When Prompted**  
   - You will be asked to upload a content and style image via file upload.

4. **Run All Cells in Order**

5. **View the Result**  
   The stylized output will appear in your notebook after a few optimization steps.

## ‚úÖ Example Output

If you use a bird image as content and a cyberpunk fantasy illustration as the style, the result will be a bird that looks painted in colorful brush strokes ‚Äî vibrant, dreamlike, and artistic.

- Automatically detects uploaded image names.
- Converts RGBA images to RGB to avoid tensor mismatch errors.
- Works on CPU or GPU (Colab automatically selects GPU if available).
- Pretrained VGG19 model is used for feature extraction.
- Simple code style written like a beginner for easy understanding.
